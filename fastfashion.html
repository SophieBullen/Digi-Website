        <p>Everyone knows that this means that they enslave children all over the world, working for less than a dollar a day. However, how many people still buy from places like these, knowing that they are responsible for the continued enslavement of children all across the globe.</p>
        
        <p>How many people continue to buy, knowing about this and not caring? How many people are there who are constant enslaved because people all over the world are too selfish to care about humans with lives like their's, but lives that could never be like theirs because it is them who work for the people who don't care.</p>

        <p>These people are just that. People. With feelings and families and lives that could be just like yours or mine if we just found it in ourselves to care. Most people, after reading this, would simply go back to their daily lives and pretend nothing is wrong, that they don't buy on a daily basis from brands that enslave children their age and younger.</p>

            <h3>I'm begging you, don't be one of those people. Don't be one of those people who is willing to go back to being a selfish, unfeeling robot who can't care about people they don't know, content to live out their lives without doing anything. Find it in yourself to care. Then, find it in yourself to make a difference.</h3>
